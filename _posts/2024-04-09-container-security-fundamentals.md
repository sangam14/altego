Container security has become crucial as organizations adopt containerization and orchestration platforms like Docker and Kubernetes. Let's dive into the fundamental aspects of securing your containerized applications.

## Container Security Basics

### 1. Image Security
- Use official base images
- Regularly scan for vulnerabilities
- Implement image signing
- Keep base images updated

### 2. Runtime Security
- Implement pod security policies
- Use network policies
- Enable runtime security monitoring
- Implement resource limits

### 3. Access Control
- Use RBAC for Kubernetes
- Implement service accounts
- Secure API server access
- Regular access audits

## Best Practices

### Docker Security
- Run containers with minimal privileges
- Use seccomp profiles
- Implement content trust
- Regular security audits

### Kubernetes Security
- Enable Pod Security Admission
- Use Network Policies
- Implement mTLS with service mesh
- Regular cluster hardening

### CI/CD Security
- Scan images in pipeline
- Implement policy as code
- Use secure registries
- Automated security testing

Remember to always follow the principle of least privilege and regularly update your security policies to address new threats in the container ecosystem.
